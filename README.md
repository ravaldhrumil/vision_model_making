# Features

+ This a very well behaving module which helps anyone to **train their own model with their own set of images.**
+ Anyone without very deep knowledge of Neural Networks can also use it.
+ It trains your model on various numbers of different available pre-trained models.
+ User can also provide their **own set of different hyper parameters**.
+ **As many models** can be trained on the single dataset as user wants.
+ Trained model can be used to make prediction and also can be **downloaded** as per choice.

# How to use 

1. First of all user needs to upload the zipped folder of their data in a given available formats.
    - If the folder is as per the given guidelines than folder will be approved and user can proceed further, other-wise it will throw an error.

> 2. After it user is provided various informatin about the folder they have uploaded and now they will be asked different kind of parameters for their model to train on.
>    > ### Parameters
>        > -  Pre-trained model
>        > - Learning Rate
>        > - Epochs

3. Now the model is being trained.

4. After the model is trained, user will be provided the graphs of training results along with various other training related data.

5. Here user can choose to train the model again with different parameters or can go ahead with trained model/s he has had.

> 6. Now either model can be used for prediction or for download.
>    > ### Using model
>       > - User will be allowed to choose from the various models he has trained on same dataset for prediction.
>        >
>       > - Any image can be uploaded and predicton about that image will be provided (This step cn be repeated as much as time user wants).
>
>    > ### Downloading model 
>        > - A zip folder with all the model/s he has trained will be made available to download along with training data of each model and a readme file on how to use it.
